<h2>Features</h2>

  <div class="featurerowwrapper">
    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Command Line Interface</h3>
      <p>The command line interface allows you to focus on performing the test instead of breaking your train of thought by clicking around a GUI.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature right">
      <h3>New Interface, Familiar Workflow</h3>
      <p>Pappy has the standard features of Burp Suite and supports a similar workflow to Burp Suite for manual testing. Map the site, find interesting requests, send them to repeater, and poke.</p>

    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Response Streaming</h3>
      <p>Pappy will stream data to the browser as it gets it instead of waiting for the full response to be downloaded first. This makes browsing through Pappy feel much faster than browsing through other proxies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature right">
      <h3>Powerful History Search</h3>
      <p>Pappy has a very powerful history search. By applying multiple filters in a row, you can continuously remove requests you don't need from view. For example, you can <a href="http://blog.pappyproxy.com/post/142814650454/finding-post-requests-without-csrf-header">find POST requests without a CSRF header</a> in only 2 commands!</p>

    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Self-Contained Project Directory</h3>
      <p>Pappy keeps everything related to a project (including proxy settings) contained in one directory. This makes switching between projects a breeze.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature right">
      <h3>Python Macros</h3>
      <p>When creating automated attacks, Pappy prefers Python. Pappy allows you to generate the boilerplate for attack scripts so that you only have to write a few lines to perform scripted attacks.</p>
